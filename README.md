# Malaria-Classifier
Project made for FWRSEF 2020. Construction of a 3-layer Convolutional Neural Network to analyze, classify, and predict malaria infection in human cells.

Conducted research independently, created a 3-layer convolutional neural network to analyze thousands of cells from the NIH database for possible malaria infection using Python (TensorFlow framework and Keras library) in the hopes of reducing the time and effort involved in the current developing world process of malaria detection; achieved a testing accuracy of 93.49%
